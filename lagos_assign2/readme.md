Information Architect = Fiyinfoluwa Oluyinka

As the information Architect on this project, I collected the individual php files (3 of them) corresponding to each member of the team. I then ensured that we were able to have general sub headings, with enough content to go into each of the sub headings, in order for the overall structure of the website to remain consisten amongst all pages (besides the home page). For the purpose of arranging, I divided the writeups into three broad headings (About Me, Work Experience, and Extra-Curricular activities). I then decided to arrange the content in a grid layout, with the About me and Work Experience on the left, While the Extra-Curricular activities were arranged on the right. 

To navigate betweeen each of the pages, I went with a horizontal navigation bar, with 4 "buttons" corresponding to the 4 pages of the website (Home, Informational Architect, Coder and Design Artist). I also ensured that the current page was highlighted in the navigation bar in order for users to know what page they were currently on. Also for navigation purposes, I made a link on the image of our city, and name of the team, so that when either of them are clicked, the user is directed to the home page of the website.

Lastly, I made use of media queries in order to accomodate users accessing the website from different browsers or devices of different widths. For example, when the browser width is below 600px, the layout changes to a block layout, thereby making it easier for the user to read in one "column", scrolling up or down.






Coder = Olatunde Oshunlaja

As the coder in this assignment I contributed in the following ways:
I ensured that the HTML and CSS files successfully passed validation
I  used  PHP includes to factor out common elements
I ensured that all files in the file system followed the industry’s best practices such as lower case names for all the files and images.
and finally made sure the JS plugin on the homepage was working well and optimized

Design Architect = Prospepr Feya
My role as the Design Architect was to make sure that I give an elegance of the designer’s touch to the assignment. This included bringing certain CSS font styles, layouts, colors and text to the website. I further ensured that the presentation layer (styles) is coded in CSS so it is visually arranged a way that makes sense for the content and adds value to the structure layer.
I used a navigation css file to find your way through the webpage. This also ensures that you see the images
for every team member.
