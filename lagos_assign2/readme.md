Coder = Olatunde Oshunlaja

As the coder in this assignment I contributed in the following ways:
I ensured that the HTML and CSS files successfully passed validation
I  used  PHP includes to factor out common elements
I ensured that all files in the file system followed the industryâ€™s best practices such as lower case names for all the files and images.
and finally made sure the JS plugin on the homepage was working well and optimized
