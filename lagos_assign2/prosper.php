				<p>I am senior at the University of Rochester, currently studying Electrical and Computer Engineering with a concentration in Semiconductor Devices. I also minor in Computer Science (Human-Computer Interaction) and Theater. I understand at the core of your Hardware/Electrical Engineering program you value enthusiasm and willingness to drive innovation. As an undergrad, I share similar values at heart and this has been shown through design projects I have worked on.</p>

				<p>Currently, I am working on a design project called Magneto Glove with three other colleagues. This is a glove that uses accelerometers and/or flex sensors that will detect the position or gesture of your hand to control lights, volume, or other devices. The potential future use of the glove is transcribing sign language, music conduction and other functions in sign language interpretation.</p>



			<h2> Work Experience </h2>
			

			 <p>I have worked at the University of Rochester admissions and financial aid office for almost four years now. For the most part, I worked on developing the admissions website and financial documents. I have worked with the Admission office and the Dean of College Admission and Financial Aid with organizing the International Baccalaureate World Student Conference (IBWSC) which was held at the University of Rochester and took place August 3rd to the 8th and is one of two global sites for this conference geared towards the world's most active young minds. The type of help was mainly administrative style tasks. Among these include preparing housing lists from our attendees list, nametag printing and prep, move-in day support (check-in and directing our arriving students and chaperones, meet and greet at the airport, etc.).</p>


			<h3> Research Experience </h3>
			
			<p>I have done extensive research on wide band gaps, particularly Gallium Nitride (GaN) as an effective alternative to SiC, advantages of its high voltage, high switching frequencies, and outstanding reliability. The research on Wide Bandgaps (WBG) also focused particularly on GaN and its application in blue LEDs and 5G LTE. The leading material in the technology of 5G, a network that promises less than 1ms latency, 100x network energy efficiency, 20 Gbps peak data rates, and 10 Mps per square meter area traffic capacity. </p>

			<h3> Entrepreneurship </h3>


			<p>Entrepreneurially, I worked with a team of six to start =Code, a non-profit that offers high school students a standardized education in computer science that is endorsed by credible technology companies, colleges and universities in Rochester, New York. Lastly, I have designed several projects in Data Structures and Algorithms using Java. Some of the projects include Infix-Postfix Calculator using Stacks and Queues. Street Mapping project using the shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra’s algorithm), graphs and linked Lists. Point Location project with Trees and linked lists.</p>

			<h2> Extra Curricular Activities </h2>


			 <p>The second project I did stemmed from my travel home to Zimbabwe over the summer of 2017. Agriculture as we know it has changed overtime due to factors such as climate change, heat waves, rain patterns and change in soil nutrient content. Most small to medium farmers because of little capital and inputs often stick to the traditional methods and end up not getting the yield that matches the top commercial farmers. Our project Farmr, a device with an integrated circuit of sensors takes periodic measurements of soil metrics and performing analytics on this data to help maximize yield of crops. Using microcontroller modules, we made a cluster of sensor devices that interface with a web application to assist farmers in making smart farming decisions.
