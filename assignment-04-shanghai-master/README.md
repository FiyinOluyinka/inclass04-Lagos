 The role of the Technical Coder
* I created three php files the form.php, welcome.php and the testmysql-remote.php
* In the form.php, I created a basic template of a form which consisted of four fields: name, email, telephone and a text area for the description and reasons for choosing majors with which individuals who visited our site could fill.
* In the welcome.php, I wrote some codes with login details to connect to the remote database and setup something to scrub incoming form data.
* I used the testmysql-remote.php to test the connection to the database .
* I created the user urcscon3_shangh  on the bluest host service to access the blue-host remote database urcscon3_shangh.
* In the blue-host database urcscon3-shangh I created the table contact with 5 columns to store data collected from the form.php.
