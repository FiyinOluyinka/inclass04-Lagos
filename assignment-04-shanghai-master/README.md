## Design Artist - Fyinfoluwa Oluyinka
* For the purpose of this assignment I served as the Design Artist
* I performed the required tasks which included:
	* Styling every element on the website, ranging from fonts and pictures, to the layout and overall display of the website.

* First of all, I picked a bootstrap framework that served as a template for the overalll structure
* Despite there being an odd student, our central theme is international students, with 3 of the students from China, while the additional student, Olatunde was a student from Nigeria. So I took these into account when designing the webpgae.
	*For the home page, and the contact information page, I decided to make use of general header which incorporated the 2 cultures. So I chose to make the background of the header a picture of the chinese flag and the Nigerian flag which I found online. I chose to make the background image fixed, thereby creating a scroll-like effect enabling visitors to the web to be able to see the full image.

	* Within the header of the home page, I added a picture of the globe with hands around it, to give a sense of unity amongst all cultures. I chose to put this image at the center of the header, at a strategic point where the two flagpoles intersect, in order to put a "united world" at the center of the two flags.

	*For the individual pages, I followed a similar pattern. For Olatunde, the Nigerian Student, I used an image of the famous Lekki-Ikoyi link bridge located in Lagos, Nigeria, as the header for his page. While for the Chinese Students, I chose a picture of the Shanghai skyline. For consistency, I used pictures that were taken at nightime, in order for the aesthetic appeal of the website to remain constant. I also added a picture of each student's respective flags to the header/ cover photo. So for Ola there is a picture of the Nigerian Flag, whilst for the others, there is a picture of the Chinese Flag. When picking the images, I chose images where the flag was waving (appeared 3-dimension like with a shadow) because they blended better with the background photo than traditional flag pictures.

	* I also made sure I right-aligned 



## Coder - Olatunde
 The role of the Technical Coder
* I created three php files the form.php, welcome.php and the testmysql-remote.php
* In the form.php, I created a basic template of a form which consisted of four fields: name, email, telephone and a text area for the description and reasons for choosing majors with which individuals who visited our site could fill.
* In the welcome.php, I wrote some codes with login details to connect to the remote database and setup something to scrub incoming form data.
* I used the testmysql-remote.php to test the connection to the database .
* I created the user urcscon3_shangh  on the bluest host service to access the blue-host remote database urcscon3_shangh.
* In the blue-host database urcscon3-shangh I created the table contact with 5 columns to store data collected from the form.php.
* I checked all the web files and insured that they met web standards and followed best practices.
