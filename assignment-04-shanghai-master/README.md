## Design Artist - Fiyinfoluwa Oluyinka

* For the purpose of this assignment I served as the Design Artist
* I performed the required tasks which included:
	* Styling every element on the website, ranging from fonts and pictures, to the layout and overall display of the website.

* First of all, I picked a bootstrap framework that served as a template for the overalll structure
* Despite there being an odd student, our central theme is international students, with 3 of the students from China, while the additional student, Olatunde was a student from Nigeria. So I took these into account when designing the webpgae.

	* For the home page, and the contact information page, I decided to make use of general header which incorporated the 2 cultures. So I chose to make the background of the header a picture of the chinese flag and the Nigerian flag which I found online. I chose to make the background image fixed, thereby creating a scroll-like effect enabling visitors to the web to be able to see the full image.

	* Within the header of the home page, I added a picture of the globe with hands around it, to give a sense of unity amongst all cultures. I chose to put this image at the center of the header, at a strategic point where the two flagpoles intersect, in order to put a "united world" at the center of the two flags.

	* For the individual pages, I followed a similar pattern. For Olatunde, the Nigerian Student, I used an image of the famous Lekki-Ikoyi link bridge located in Lagos, Nigeria, as the header for his page. While for the Chinese Students, I chose a picture of the Shanghai skyline. For consistency, I used pictures that were taken at nightime, in order for the aesthetic appeal of the website to remain constant. I also added a picture of each student's respective flags to the header/ cover photo. So for Ola there is a picture of the Nigerian Flag, whilst for the others, there is a picture of the Chinese Flag. When picking the images, I chose images where the flag was waving (appeared 3-dimension like with a shadow) because they blended better with the background photo than traditional flag pictures.

	* I also made sure I right-aligned the flags of each of the countries in order for the page vistors to properly view the image without obstructions.


* CRAP PRINCIPLES - Throughout the website, I ensured I took the CRAP Principles into account as I designed.

	* Contrast: I did my best to demonstrate Contrast throughout the website. First of all, I put the content on each webpage of the website into seperate containers, with contrasting background colours and font colour in order to differentiate them. On the home page especially, I put Ola, the Nigerian student in the first container or row, in order to differentiate him from the chinese students. Whilst I gave the Chinese students a white background to contrast the greyish blue background that Ola had. For Ola's container, the text is white in order to improve readanility whilst for the chinese students, they have a black text on a white background. The background of the footer on each page is also a contrasting colour (black) from the main body (white).

	* Repition: There is a consistent repetitive pattern throughout the webpages. Each individual webpage has a cover photo of a landmark from the student's home country, as well as Flag of the country itself. This speaks to their identities. Also each individual webpage follows the same page pattern. It comes off as a Quasi- F pattern. It starts of with the cover area. Followed by the Name, major and profile picture of the student before the content begins. The contents all follow the same pattern. An about me introduction section, followed by Hobbies, and then Other Informations. The same heading sizes, fonts and colors where repeated across all the pages.

	* Alignmnent: On the home page and forms the text on the website is aligned to the center. I chose this because I felt like it helped to keep the relevant information (becasuse there isn't much of it on those pages) in the central location, making it easy to catch. On the individual pages however, becasue of the lengthy nature, the text follows the traditional left alignmnent. The images on the website follow a similar story as well. All images are alligned in the center of the containers, with the text below it, kind of like a pyramid. The only excpetion to this is in the header/ cover container of the individual pages. Here, I alligned the flags of the countries to the right, in order for the users to be able to view the cover photo properly without obstruction. 

	* Proximity: 



## Coder - Olatunde
 The role of the Technical Coder
* I created three php files the form.php, welcome.php and the testmysql-remote.php
* In the form.php, I created a basic template of a form which consisted of four fields: name, email, telephone and a text area for the description and reasons for choosing majors with which individuals who visited our site could fill.
* In the welcome.php, I wrote some codes with login details to connect to the remote database and setup something to scrub incoming form data.
* I used the testmysql-remote.php to test the connection to the database .
* I created the user urcscon3_shangh  on the bluest host service to access the blue-host remote database urcscon3_shangh.
* In the blue-host database urcscon3-shangh I created the table contact with 5 columns to store data collected from the form.php.
* I checked all the web files and insured that they met web standards and followed best practices.
