				<h3> Who is an Information Architect ? </h3>
				<p>
					The information Architecture of a webpage is very important. Essentially, on a web-based project or website, the Information architect prepares the content, and arranges them within each page, and across all related webpages. The IA designs the navigation elements and how navigation from page to page is presented, ensuring that is correctly presented in any browser, on any device, irrespective of the size. Finally, the IA leads the team collaboration (Github) and manages the file structures.
				</p>

					<p> Essentially it is the responsibility of the Information Architect to ensure that : </p>

					<ul>
						<li> There are no usability problems </li>
						<li> The structure layer (content) is coded in HTML so it is arranged and accessible in a way that makes sense for the content </li>
						<li> Content structure (HTML) meets industry standards and best practices including W3C HTML validation within reason </li>
						<li> The team is coordinated and effective with no complaints </li>

					</ul>
				<p>
					Personally, I chose this because I see this as an opportunity to improve upon my organization and structural skills, thus helping me become a neater web developer, and to further improve upon my overall understanding and conceptualization of HTML, CSS, PHP and Javascript.
